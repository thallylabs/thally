/**
 * Build the workspace packages in dependency order, parallelizing where the
 * dependency graph allows.
 *
 * The graph (from each package's tsup config and dependencies):
 * - core and migrate have no @thallylabs/* build-time dependencies and build
 *   concurrently.
 * - create-thally-docs imports @thallylabs/migrate and its declaration build
 *   needs migrate's generated types, so it builds next.
 * - mcp consumes the canonical create-thally-docs scaffold and release
 *   declarations, so it builds after create-thally-docs.
 * - agent marks @thallylabs/mcp external at runtime, but its `dts: true`
 *   type build reads mcp's generated declarations — it builds after mcp.
 * - cli sets `noExternal: ['@thallylabs/agent']`, bundling agent's dist into
 *   the CLI at build time — it must build last.
 *
 * The previous fully-serial `npm run build -w … && …` chain paid all five
 * builds back to back on every engine build; the fan-out keeps the ordering
 * constraints while letting the independent half run at once.
