# create-thally-docs

Scaffold an open-source [Thally](https://github.com/thallylabs/thally) docs
site for people, search engines, and AI tools. The result keeps your source in
Git and publishes each page as HTML, Markdown, structured JSON, JSON-LD, and
agent discovery files.

## Quick start

```bash
npx create-thally-docs my-docs
cd my-docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server starts at [http://localhost:3040](http://localhost:3040) and
automatically uses the next available port when needed. A freshly scaffolded
site is agent-ready out of the box and scores 100/A on the built-in
[Agent Readiness Score](https://github.com/thallylabs/thally).

Run non-interactively with smart defaults:

```bash
npx create-thally-docs my-docs --yes
```

Dependency installation is deliberately opt-in so the scaffold finishes in
seconds. Pass `--install` to run it immediately, or `--no-install` to skip the
interactive question explicitly.

## Terminal output

Interactive terminals show the THALLY wordmark, task headings, and live progress.
The wordmark adapts to narrow terminals. Output automatically
uses plain text in CI, when output is not a TTY, with `TERM=dumb`, or when
`NO_COLOR` is set.

Setup and migration end with a highlighted next-action panel. The preview
command is one copyable line, including `npm install` when needed.

Scaffolding and migration keep subprocess logs quiet in interactive terminals.
Add `--verbose` to see installation and build logs as they happen:

```bash
npx create-thally-docs my-docs --yes --install --verbose
npx create-thally-docs migrate https://github.com/your-org/your-docs --platform auto --verbose
```

Long-running steps show their current activity and elapsed time. Plain logs report an elapsed heartbeat every 15 seconds. Conversion, rendering, and content validation run off the terminal thread so progress keeps updating during larger imports.

Failures always show diagnostics, including without `--verbose`; quiet output retains the last 64 KiB. Non-interactive
runs retain subprocess output for scripts and CI. These options also work with
`thally init` and `thally migrate`.

## What you get

- **MDX content** in `src/content/`, navigation in `docs.json`
- **Agent endpoints** — `/llms.txt`, `/ai.txt`, `/api/docs-index`, `/api/agent-readiness`
- **Hybrid search**, **retrieval-grounded AI chat**, and an **admin analytics** dashboard
- **Starter content** with keywords and structured pages, ready to edit

## Other commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `create-thally-docs <dir>` | Scaffold a new project |
| `create-thally-docs migrate <github-or-docs-url> [dir]` | Import a docs repository or public docs site through the shared migration engine |
| `create-thally-docs check [dir] [--fix]` | Lint content for orphan pages and missing frontmatter |
| `create-thally-docs translate --locale <code>` | Translate content into another locale |

Interactive migrations ask whether the source is Mintlify, Docusaurus, or
another auto-detected platform. When automatic detection receives a live
website URL, the CLI recommends its source GitHub repository and requires
confirmation before continuing with the less precise website crawl. For
scripts and CI, pass
`--platform mintlify`, `--platform docusaurus`, or `--platform auto`; `--yes`
keeps backward-compatible auto-detection when no platform flag is supplied.
Explicit `--platform auto` and `--yes` runs print the live-site limitation
without introducing an interactive prompt. Running `migrate` without
`--platform` or `--yes` from a non-interactive shell (a script, a CI job, a
piped command) also skips the platform prompt — it can't be answered there —
and auto-detects instead, with a warning naming the flag that silences it.

Mintlify repository migrations preserve the source information architecture
instead of rebuilding navigation from folders: nested project roots, `$ref`
navigation files, tabs, groups, dropdowns, products, versions, languages,
redirects, page metadata, snippets, assets, and compatible OpenAPI settings are
projected into Thally. A live Mintlify URL uses the structured configuration
embedded by Mintlify when it is available, with bounded same-site crawling as a
fallback.

Migrated OpenAPI specs are written to `openapi/`, not `public/` (which the host
serves as-is). `--into` never deletes files: an older copy of a spec already in
`public/` stays publicly downloadable (a `public/openapi.json` even answers
`/openapi.json` in place of the filtered spec), so the migration lists such files and
`thally check` warns about them until you delete them manually.

Repository-local JSX/TSX components and supported static dependencies are copied
into the customer-owned MDX registry. Simple interactive HTML blocks are moved
into client components, and locale/root routing is normalized. Unsupported
customizations remain visible as warnings rather than being silently dropped.

After importing, the CLI automatically installs dependencies for fresh projects,
runs static content checks and a production build, and writes
`migration-report.json`. A failed check or build returns a nonzero exit status;
the imported files remain available for inspection. Warnings may include
pre-existing source problems and compatibility limitations even when a build
passes. Review them before publishing. Use `--skip-validation` for an explicit
import-only run; its report is marked unverified. An existing `--into` project
without a build script is also reported as unverified.

Migration is a local build workflow for projects you own or trust. Dependency
installation and builds execute project code, including imported MDX and
JSX/TSX; they are not sandboxed. No additional confirmation or execution flag
is needed. `--skip-validation` also skips dependency installation.

A fresh migration leaves the destination repository unset. After creating the
new repository, set `site.repoUrl` in `src/data/site.ts` to its root GitHub URL
to enable edit and issue links. The source location remains in the migration
report; it is not used as the destination for reader feedback.

Prefer a single binary? Install [`@thallylabs/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thallylabs/cli)
and use `thally init`, which delegates here.
